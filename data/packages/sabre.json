    "description": "Sabre is a tool that will demultiplex barcoded reads into separate\nfiles. It will work on both single-end and paired-end data in fastq\nformat. It simply compares the provided barcodes with each read and\nseparates the read into its appropriate barcode file, after stripping\nthe barcode from the read (and also stripping the quality values of the\nbarcode bases). If a read does not have a recognized barcode, then it is\nput into the unknown file.\n",
