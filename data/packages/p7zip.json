This library\nprovides a unified solution for Cryptographic routines such as AES\n(Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption/decryption routines (CFB, CTR,\nCBC, CCM, GCM, OFB, SIV, XTS), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) routines\n(SHA2, SHA3, SHAKE), Message Authentication Code (CMAC, HMAC), ECDH\n(Elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman) and RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman)\nkey generation functions, etc. AOCL Crypto supports a dynamic dispatcher\nfeature that executes the most optimal function variant implemented\nusing Function Multi-versioning thereby offering a single optimized\nlibrary portable across different x86 CPU architectures. AOCL Crypto\nframework is developed in C / C++ for Unix and Windows based systems.\nLICENSING INFORMATION: By downloading, installing and using this\nsoftware, you agree to the terms and conditions of the AMD AOCL-\nCryptography license agreement.
