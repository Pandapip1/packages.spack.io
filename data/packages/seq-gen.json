    "description": "Seq-Gen is a program that will simulate the evolution of nucleotide or\namino acid sequences along a phylogeny. Seq-Gen is a program that will\nsimulate the evolution of nucleotide or amino acid sequences along a\nphylogeny, using common models of the substitution process. A range of\nmodels of molecular evolution are implemented including the general\nreversible model. State frequencies and other parameters of the model\nmay be given and site-specific rate heterogeneity may also be\nincorporated in a number of ways. Any number of trees may be read in and\nthe program will produce any number of data sets for each tree. Thus\nlarge sets of replicate simulations can be easily created. It has been\ndesigned to be a general purpose simulator that incorporates most of the\ncommonly used (and computationally tractable) models of molecular\nsequence evolution.\n",
