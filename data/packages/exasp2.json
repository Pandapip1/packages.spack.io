    "description": "ExaSP2 is a reference implementation of typical linear algebra\nalgorithms and workloads for a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)\nelectronic structure code. The algorithm is based on a recursive second-\norder Fermi-Operator expansion method (SP2) and is tailored for density\nfunctional based tight-binding calculations of material systems. The SP2\nalgorithm variants are part of the Los Alamos Transferable Tight-binding\nfor Energetics (LATTE) code, based on a matrix expansion of the Fermi\noperator in a recursive series of generalized matrix-matrix\nmultiplications. It is created and maintained by Co-Design Center for\nParticle Applications (CoPA). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle\nfor co-design by allowing others to extend and/or reimplement as needed\nto test performance of new architectures, programming models, etc.\n",

XBLAS is a\nreference implementation for the dense and banded BLAS routines, along\nwith extended and mixed precision version. Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
