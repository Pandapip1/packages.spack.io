    "description": "The reproject package is a Python package to reproject astronomical\nimages using various techniques via a uniform interface. By\nreprojection, we mean the re-gridding of images from one world\ncoordinate system to another (for example changing the pixel resolution,\norientation, coordinate system). Currently, we have implemented\nreprojection of celestial images by interpolation (like SWARP), as well\nas by finding the exact overlap between pixels on the celestial sphere\n(like Montage). It can also reproject to/from HEALPIX projections by\nrelying on the astropy-healpix package.\n",
