Supports RSA, DSA and EC curves P-256, P-384 and P-521.\nCryptographic signatures can either be created and verified manually or\nvia x509 certificates. AES can be used in cbc, ctr or gcm mode for\nsymmetric encryption; RSA for asymmetric (public key) encryption or EC\nfor Diffie Hellman. High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES\nfor encrypting arbitrary sized data. Other utilities include key\ngenerators, hash functions (md5, sha1, sha256, etc), base64 encoder, a\nsecure random number generator, and 'bignum' math methods for manually\nperforming crypto calculations on large multibyte integers."
