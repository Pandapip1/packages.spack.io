    "description": "The PEXSI library is written in C++, and uses message passing interface\n(MPI) to parallelize the computation on distributed memory computing\nsystems and achieve scalability on more than 10,000 processors. The Pole\nEXpansion and Selected Inversion (PEXSI) method is a fast method for\nelectronic structure calculation based on Kohn-Sham density functional\ntheory. It efficiently evaluates certain selected elements of matrix\nfunctions, e.g., the Fermi-Dirac function of the KS Hamiltonian, which\nyields a density matrix. It can be used as an alternative to\ndiagonalization methods for obtaining the density, energy and forces in\nelectronic structure calculations.\n",
