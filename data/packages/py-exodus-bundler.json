Whereas the kernel (Linux)\ngoverns access to hardware, memory, filesystems, and the privileges for\naccessing these resources, the C library is responsible for providing\nthe actual C function interfaces userspace applications see, and for\nconstructing higher-level buffered stdio, memory allocation management,\nthread creation and synchronization operations, and so on using the\nlower-level interfaces the kernel provides, as well as for implementing\npure library routines of the C language like strstr, snprintf, strtol,\nexp, sqrt, etc. Musl is a new general-purpose implementation of the C\nlibrary. It is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and aims to be correct\nin the sense of standards-conformance and safety."
