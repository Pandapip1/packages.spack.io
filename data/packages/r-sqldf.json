    "description": "The sqldf() function is typically passed a single argument which is an\nSQL select statement where the table names are ordinary R data frame\nnames. sqldf() transparently sets up a database, imports the data frames\ninto that database, performs the SQL select or other statement and\nreturns the result using a heuristic to determine which class to assign\nto each column of the returned data frame. The sqldf() or read.csv.sql()\nfunctions can also be used to read filtered files into R even if the\noriginal files are larger than R itself can handle. 'RSQLite', 'RH2',\n'RMySQL' and 'RPostgreSQL' backends are supported.\n",

            "description": "gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function or certain other\nobjects instead of the replacement string. Matches and back references\nare input to the replacement function and replaced by the function\noutput. gsubfn can be used to split strings based on content rather than\ndelimiters and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The package\nalso has facilities for translating formulas to functions and allowing\nsuch formulas in function calls instead of functions. This can be used\nwith R functions such as apply, sapply, lapply, optim, integrate,\nxyplot, Filter and any other function that expects another function as\nan input argument or functions like cat or sql calls that may involve\nstrings where substitution is desirable."
