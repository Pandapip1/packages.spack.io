It supports data\nstructures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range\nqueries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries\nand streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU\neviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and\nprovides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning\nwith Redis Cluster\n",
