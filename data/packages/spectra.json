It is a C++ library for large scale eigenvalue\nproblems, built on top of Eigen, an open source linear algebra library.\nSpectra is implemented as a header-only C++ library, whose only\ndependency, Eigen, is also header-only. Hence Spectra can be easily\nembedded in C++ projects that require calculating eigenvalues of large\nmatrices.\n",
