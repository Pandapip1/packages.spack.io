    "description": "FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and\nof both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the\ndiscrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST). This package is a wrapper\nfor Cray's version of FFTW. To install this package, list it as an\nexternal package in packages.yaml, and make sure to load the correct\ncray-fftw module. In some cases you need to load cray-mpich before cray-\nfftw.\n",
