    "description": "Manipulate and Visualize VCF Data Facilitates easy manipulation of\nvariant call format (VCF) data. Functions are provided to rapidly read\nfrom and write to VCF files. Once VCF data is read into R a parser\nfunction extracts matrices of data. This information can then be used\nfor quality control or other purposes. Additional functions provide\nvisualization of genomic data. Once processing is complete data may be\nwritten to a VCF file (*.vcf.gz). It also may be converted into other\npopular R objects (e.g., genlight, DNAbin). VcfR provides a link between\nVCF data and familiar R software.\n",
