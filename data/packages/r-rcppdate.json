'date' is a\nC++ header library offering extensive date and time functionality for\nthe C++11, C++14 and C++17 standards written by Howard Hinnant and\nreleased under the MIT license. A slightly modified version has been\naccepted (along with 'tz.h') as part of C++20. This package regroups all\nheader files from the upstream repository by Howard Hinnant so that\nother R packages can use them in their C++ code. At present, few of the\ntypes have explicit 'Rcpp' wrapper though these may be added as needed.\n",
