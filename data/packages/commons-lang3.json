Lang provides a host of helper utilities for the\njava.lang API, notably String manipulation methods, basic numerical\nmethods, object reflection, concurrency, creation and serialization and\nSystem properties. Additionally it contains basic enhancements to\njava.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with building\nmethods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.\n",
