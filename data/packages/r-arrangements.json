Fast generators and iterators for\npermutations, combinations, integer partitions and compositions.

It has been demonstrated that 'arrangements'\noutperforms most existing packages of similar kind. Benchmarks could be\nfound at\n<https://randy3k.github.io/arrangements/articles/benchmark.html>.\n",
