HDF5's main features are the ability to store and access very large\nand/or complex datasets and a wide variety of metadata on mass storage\n(disk) through a completely portable file format. The rhdf5 package is\nthus suited for the exchange of large and/or complex datasets between R\nand other software package, and for letting R applications work on\ndatasets that are larger than the available RAM."
