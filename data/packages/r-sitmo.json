    "description": "Provided within are two high quality and fast PPRNGs that may be used in\nan 'OpenMP' parallel environment. In addition, there is a generator for\none dimensional low-discrepancy sequence. The objective of this library\nto consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo' (C++98 & C++11),\n'threefry' and 'vandercorput' (C++11-only) engines on CRAN by enabling\nothers to link to the header files inside of 'sitmo' instead of\nincluding a copy of each engine within their individual package. Lastly,\nthe package contains example implementations using the 'sitmo' package\nand three accompanying vignette that provide additional information.\n",

In addition fast functions for generating random\nnumbers according to a uniform, normal and exponential distribution are\nincluded. The latter two use the Ziggurat algorithm originally proposed\nby Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>). These\nfunctions are exported to R and as a C++ interface and are enabled for\nuse with the default 64 bit generator from the PCG family, Xoroshiro128+\nand Xoshiro256+ as well as the 64 bit version of the 20 rounds Threefry\nengine (Salmon et al., 2011 <doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405>) as provided\nby the package 'sitmo'."
