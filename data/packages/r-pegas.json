Phylogeny estimation can be done with\nthe NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods, and several methods\nhandling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*, BIONJ*, MVR*, and the\ncorresponding triangle method). Some functions call external\napplications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee, Muscle) whose results are\nreturned into R."

It also implements original multivariate\nmethods (DAPC, sPCA), graphics, statistical tests, simulation tools,\ndistance and similarity measures, and several spatial methods. A range\nof both empirical and simulated datasets is also provided to illustrate\nvarious methods."
