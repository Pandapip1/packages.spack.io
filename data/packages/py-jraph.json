With its updated version of Autograd, JAX can\nautomatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions. It can\ndifferentiate through loops, branches, recursion, and closures, and it\ncan take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports reverse-\nmode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation) via grad as well as\nforward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily to\nany order."
