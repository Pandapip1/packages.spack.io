    "description": "This is a Python implementation of Seriation algorithm. Seriation is an\napproach for ordering elements in a set so that the sum of the\nsequential pairwise distances is minimal. We state this task as a\nTravelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and leverage the powerful Google's or-\ntools to do heavy-lifting. Since TSP is NP-hard, it is not possible to\ncalculate the precise solution for a big number of elements. However,\nthe or-tools' heuristics work very well in practice, and they are used\nin e.g. Google Maps.\n",
