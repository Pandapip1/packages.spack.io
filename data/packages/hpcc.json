    "description": "HPC Challenge is a benchmark suite that measures a range memory access\npatterns. The HPC Challenge benchmark consists of basically 7 tests: 1)\nHPL - the Linpack TPP benchmark which measures the floating point rate\nof execution for solving a linear system of equations. 2) DGEMM -\nmeasures the floating point rate of execution of double precision real\nmatrix-matrix multiplication. 3) STREAM - a simple synthetic benchmark\nprogram that measures sustainable memory bandwidth (in GB/s) and the\ncorresponding computation rate for simple vector kernel. 4) PTRANS\n(parallel matrix transpose) - exercises the communications where pairs\nof processors communicate with each other simultaneously. It is a useful\ntest of the total communications capacity of the network. 5)\nRandomAccess - measures the rate of integer random updates of memory\n(GUPS). 6) FFT - measures the floating point rate of execution of double\nprecision complex one-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). 7)\nCommunication bandwidth and latency - a set of tests to measure latency\nand bandwidth of a number of simultaneous communication patterns; based\non b_eff (effective bandwidth benchmark).\n",
