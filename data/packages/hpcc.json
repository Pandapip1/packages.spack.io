    "description": "HPC Challenge is a benchmark suite that measures a range memory access\npatterns. The HPC Challenge benchmark consists of basically 7 tests: 1)\nHPL - the Linpack TPP benchmark which measures the floating point rate\nof execution for solving a linear system of equations. 2) DGEMM -\nmeasures the floating point rate of execution of double precision real\nmatrix-matrix multiplication. 3) STREAM - a simple synthetic benchmark\nprogram that measures sustainable memory bandwidth (in GB/s) and the\ncorresponding computation rate for simple vector kernel. 4) PTRANS\n(parallel matrix transpose) - exercises the communications where pairs\nof processors communicate with each other simultaneously. It is a useful\ntest of the total communications capacity of the network. 5)\nRandomAccess - measures the rate of integer random updates of memory\n(GUPS). 6) FFT - measures the floating point rate of execution of double\nprecision complex one-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). 7)\nCommunication bandwidth and latency - a set of tests to measure latency\nand bandwidth of a number of simultaneous communication patterns; based\non b_eff (effective bandwidth benchmark).\n",

XBLAS is a\nreference implementation for the dense and banded BLAS routines, along\nwith extended and mixed precision version. Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
