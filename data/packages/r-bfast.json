This includes methods\nto fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g., CUSUM, MOSUM,\nrecursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively. It is\npossible to monitor incoming data online using fluctuation processes.\nFinally, the breakpoints in regression models with structural changes\ncan be estimated together with confidence intervals. Emphasis is always\ngiven to methods for visualizing the data."
