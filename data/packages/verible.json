    "description": "The Verible project\u2019s main mission is to parse SystemVerilog (IEEE\n1800-2017) (as standardized in the [SV-LRM]) for a wide variety of\napplications, including developer tools. It was born out of a need to\nparse un-preprocessed source files, which is suitable for single-file\napplications like style-linting and formatting. In doing so, it can be\nadapted to parse preprocessed source files, which is what real compilers\nand toolchains require. The spirit of the project is that no-one should\never have to develop a SystemVerilog parser for their own application,\nbecause developing a standard-compliant parser is an enormous task due\nto the syntactic complexity of the language. Verible\u2019s parser is also\nregularly tested against an ever-growing suite of (tool-independent)\nlanguage compliance tests at https://symbiflow.github.io/sv-tests/. A\nlesser (but notable) objective is that the language-agnostic components\nof Verible be usable for rapidly developing language support tools for\nother languages.\n",
