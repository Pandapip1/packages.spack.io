    "description": "GASNet is a language-independent, networking middleware layer that\nprovides network-independent, high-performance communication primitives\nincluding Remote Memory Access (RMA) and Active Messages (AM). It has\nbeen used to implement parallel programming models and libraries such as\nUPC, UPC++, Co-Array Fortran, Legion, Chapel, and many others. The\ninterface is primarily intended as a compilation target and for use by\nruntime library writers (as opposed to end users), and the primary goals\nare high performance, interface portability, and expressiveness.\n***NOTICE***: The GASNet library built by this Spack package is ONLY\nintended for unit-testing purposes, and is generally UNSUITABLE FOR\nPRODUCTION USE. The RECOMMENDED way to build GASNet is as an embedded\nlibrary as configured by the higher-level client runtime package (UPC++,\nLegion, etc), including system-specific configuration.\n",
