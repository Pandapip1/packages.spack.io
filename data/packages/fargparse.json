We have found that these containers are a powerful\nproductivity multiplier for certain types of software development, and\nhope that others find them to be just as useful. Currently, the\nfollowing three types of containers are provided. * Vector (list) * Set\n* Map (associated array) Contributions of additional containers are very\nmuch welcomed."
