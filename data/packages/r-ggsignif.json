This package provides\nan easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different.\nCommonly this is shown by a bracket on top connecting the groups of\ninterest which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS,\n*, **, ***). The package provides a single layer (geom_signif()) that\ntakes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text()\netc.) as arguments and adds the annotation to the plot.\n",
