    "description": "Pipe-Friendly Framework for Basic Statistical Tests Provides a simple\nand intuitive pipe-friendly framework, coherent with the 'tidyverse'\ndesign philosophy, for performing basic statistical tests, including\nt-test, Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and correlation analyses.\nThe output of each test is automatically transformed into a tidy data\nframe to facilitate visualization. Additional functions are available\nfor reshaping, reordering, manipulating and visualizing correlation\nmatrix. Functions are also included to facilitate the analysis of\nfactorial experiments, including purely 'within-Ss' designs (repeated\nmeasures), purely 'between-Ss' designs, and mixed 'within-and-between-\nSs' designs. It's also possible to compute several effect size metrics,\nincluding \"eta squared\" for ANOVA, \"Cohen's d\" for t-test and 'Cramer V'\nfor the association between categorical variables. The package contains\nhelper functions for identifying univariate and multivariate outliers,\nassessing normality and homogeneity of variances.\n",
