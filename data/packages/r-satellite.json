    "description": "Handling and Manipulating Remote Sensing Data Herein, we provide a broad\nvariety of functions which are useful for handling, manipulating, and\nvisualizing satellite-based remote sensing data. These operations range\nfrom mere data import and layer handling (eg subsetting), over Raster*\ntypical data wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more sophisticated\n(pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery (eg\natmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality is\ncomplemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any\nstage and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file.\nCurrently available sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8\n(OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional compatibility is ensured for the\nLandsat Global Land Survey data set.\n",
