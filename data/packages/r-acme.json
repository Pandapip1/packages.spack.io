    "description": "Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment (ACME) ACME (Algorithms\nfor Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is a set of tools for analysing\ntiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse hypersensitivity, or other experiments\nthat result in regions of the genome showing \"enrichment\". It does not\nrely on a specific array technology (although the array should be a\n\"tiling\" array), is very general (can be applied in experiments\nresulting in regions of enrichment), and is very insensitive to array\nnoise or normalization methods. It is also very fast and can be applied\non whole-genome tiling array experiments quite easily with enough\nmemory.\n",
