    "description": "'ViennaCL' C++ Header Files. 'ViennaCL' is a free open-source linear\nalgebra library for computations on many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC)\nand multi-core CPUs. The library is written in C++ and supports 'CUDA',\n'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP' (including switches at runtime). I have placed\nthese libraries in this package as a more efficient distribution system\nfor CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package that depends on the\n'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to distribute a copy of this\ncode with your package.\n",
