In addition, it consists of an easy-\nto-use mini-batch loader for many small and single giant graphs, multi\ngpu-support, a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on\nsimple interfaces to create your own), and helpful transforms, both for\nlearning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds."
