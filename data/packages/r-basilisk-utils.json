This allows us to avoid re-writing the same R code in both the\nconfigure script (for centrally administered R installations) and in the\nlazy installation mechanism (for distributed package binaries). It is\nhighly unlikely that developers - or, heaven forbid, end-users! - will\nneed to interact with this package directly; they should be using the\nbasilisk package instead.\n",
