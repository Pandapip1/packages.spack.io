    "description": "Optimal Thresholding Fisher's P-Value Combination Method. We provide the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and statistical power\ncalculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher's p-value combination\nmethods, including Fisher's p-value combination method, truncated\nproduct method and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's p-value\ncombination method which is proven to be optimal in some context of\nsignal detection. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version of\nthese tests are also included. For reference, please see Hong Zhang and\nZheyang Wu. \"TFisher Tests: Optimal and Adaptive Thresholding for\nCombining p-Values\", submitted.\n",
