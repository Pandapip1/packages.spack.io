    "description": "Several fast random number generators are provided as C++ header only\nlibraries: The PCG family by O'Neill (2014\n<https://www.cs.hmc.edu/tr/hmc-cs-2014-0905.pdf>) as well as\nXoroshiro128+ and Xoshiro256+ by Blackman and Vigna (2018\n<arXiv:1805.01407>). In addition fast functions for generating random\nnumbers according to a uniform, normal and exponential distribution are\nincluded. The latter two use the Ziggurat algorithm originally proposed\nby Marsaglia and Tsang (2000, <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>). These\nfunctions are exported to R and as a C++ interface and are enabled for\nuse with the default 64 bit generator from the PCG family, Xoroshiro128+\nand Xoshiro256+ as well as the 64 bit version of the 20 rounds Threefry\nengine (Salmon et al., 2011 <doi:10.1145/2063384.2063405>) as provided\nby the package 'sitmo'.\n",
