    "description": "Parametric Time Warping. Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e.\nit aims to put corresponding features at the same locations. The\nalgorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It\nis possible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the\nsame reference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site.\n",

An efficient C++\nbased implementation of the 'DEoptim' function which performs global\noptimization by differential evolution. Its creation was motivated by\ntrying to see if the old approximation \"easier, shorter, faster: pick\nany two\" could in fact be extended to achieving all three goals while\nmoving the code from plain old C to modern C++. The initial version did\nin fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an implicit code\nreview which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since been\neliminated in 'DEoptim'."
