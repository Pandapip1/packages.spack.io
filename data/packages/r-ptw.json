    "description": "Parametric Time Warping Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e. it\naims to put corresponding features at the same locations. The algorithm\nsearches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It is\npossible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the same\nreference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site.\n",

NLopt is a free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization,\nproviding a common interface for a number of different free optimization\nroutines available online as well as original implementations of various\nother algorithms. See <http://ab-\ninitio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction> for more information\non the available algorithms. During installation of nloptr on Unix-based\nsystems, the installer checks whether the NLopt library is installed on\nthe system. If the NLopt library cannot be found, the code is compiled\nusing the NLopt source included in the nloptr package."
