    "description": "Background noise and signal reverberation due to reflections in an\nenclosure are the two main impairments in acoustic signal processing and\nfar-field speech recognition. This work addresses signal dereverberation\ntechniques based on WPE for speech recognition and other far-field\napplications. WPE is a compelling algorithm to blindly dereverberate\nacoustic signals based on long-term linear prediction.\n",
