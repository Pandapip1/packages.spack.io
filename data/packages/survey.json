The\nsurvey collector/analytics framework is a new generation, high level,\nlightweight multiplatform Linux tool set that targets metric collection\nfor high level performance analysis of applications running on both\nsingle node and on large scale platforms, including the Cray platforms.\nThe collector is designed to work on sequential, MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid\ncodes and directly leverages several interfaces available for tools\ninside current MPI implementations including: MPICH, MVAPICH, MPT, and\nOpenMPI. It also supports multiple architectures and has been tested on\nmachines based on Intel, AMD, ARM, and IBM P8/9 processors and\nintegrated GPUs. Survey is a licensed product with the source not openly\navailable.
