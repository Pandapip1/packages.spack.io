The\ninterface is primarily intended as a compilation target and for use by\nruntime library writers (as opposed to end users), and the primary goals\nare high performance, interface portability, and expressiveness.\n***NOTICE***: The GASNet library built by this Spack package is ONLY\nintended for unit-testing purposes, and is generally UNSUITABLE FOR\nPRODUCTION USE. The RECOMMENDED way to build GASNet is as an embedded\nlibrary as configured by the higher-level client runtime package (UPC++,\nLegion, etc), including system-specific configuration."
