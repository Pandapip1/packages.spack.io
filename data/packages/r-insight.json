'insight' mainly revolves around two types\nof functions: Functions that find (the names of) information, starting\nwith 'find_', and functions that get the underlying data, starting with\n'get_'. The package has a consistent syntax and works with many\ndifferent model objects, where otherwise functions to access these\ninformation are missing.\n",
