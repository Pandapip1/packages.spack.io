    "description": "VACUUMMS: (Void Analysis Codes and Unix Utilities for Molecular Modeling\nand Simulation) is a collection of research codes for the compuational\nanalysis of free volume in molecular structures, including the\ngeneration of code for the production of high quality ray-traced images\nand videos. Note that production of the images from the generated code\nis considered post-processing and requires POVRay and feh (on X11\nsystems) as post-processing dependencies. VACUUMMS has been tested under\nLinux on x86_64 and ARM64. Please submit questions, pull requests, and\nbug reports via github.\nhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2335755.2335826\n",
