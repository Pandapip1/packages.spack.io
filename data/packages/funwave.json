    "description": " What is FUNWAVE-TVD? FUNWAVE-TVD is the Total Variation Diminishing\n(TVD) version of the fully nonlinear Boussinesq wave model (FUNWAVE)\ndeveloped by Shi et al. (2012). The FUNWAVE model was initially\ndeveloped by Kirby et al. (1998) based on Wei et al. (1995). The\ndevelopment of the present version was motivated by recent needs for\nmodeling of surfzone--cale optical properties in a Boussinesq model\nframework, and modeling of Tsunami waves in both a global/coastal scale\nfor prediction of coastal inundation and a basin scale for wave\npropagation.\n",

The Open MPI\nProject is an open source Message Passing Interface implementation that\nis developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and\nindustry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise,\ntechnologies, and resources from all across the High Performance\nComputing community in order to build the best MPI library available.\nOpen MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application\ndevelopers and computer science researchers."
