An R\nClient for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service (see\n<https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService> for more information).

Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature\nsources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the\nagricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to\nbibliographic metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and\nreference lists. Links between life-science literature and other EBI\ndatabases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. No\nregistration or API key is required. See the vignettes for usage\nexamples.\n",

In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data.
