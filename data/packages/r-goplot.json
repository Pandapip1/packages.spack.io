It combines and integrates\nomics data derived from expression and functional annotation enrichment\nanalyses. Its plotting functions have been developed with an\nhierarchical structure in mind: starting from a general overview to\nidentify the most enriched categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot)\nto a more detailed one displaying different types of relevant\ninformation for the molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot,\nchord plot, cluster plot, Venn diagram, heatmap).\n",

Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de\nBruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a\ngiven gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to\nextract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts\nderived from paralogous genes."
