    "description": " ppOpen-MATH/VIS is a set of libraries for parallel visualization.\nCapabilities of ppOpen-MATH/VIS (ver.0.2.0) are as follows: Using\nbackground voxels with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Single UCD file.\nFlat MPI parallel programming models. (OpenMP/MPI hybrid will be\nsupported in the future). Can be called from programs written in both of\nFortran 90 and C. Only FDM-type structured meshes are supported.\n",
