The framework was designed to\nisolate essential kernels of computation that, when optimized,\nimmediately enable optimized implementations of most of its commonly\nused and computationally intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO\nC99 and available under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license. While BLIS\nexports a new BLAS-like API, it also includes a BLAS compatibility layer\nwhich gives application developers access to BLIS implementations via\ntraditional BLAS routine calls. An object-based API unique to BLIS is\nalso available."
