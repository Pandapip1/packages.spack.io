    "description": "CoEVP is a scale-bridging proxy application for embedded viscoplasticity\napplications. It is created and maintained by The Exascale Co-Design\nCenter for Materials in Extreme Environments (ExMatEx). The code is\nintended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by allowing others to\nextend and/or reimplement it as needed to test performance of new\narchitectures, programming models, etc. Due to the size and complexity\nof the studied models, as well as restrictions on distribution, the\ncurrently available LULESH proxy application provides the coarse-scale\nmodel implementation and the ASPA proxy application provides the\nadaptive sampling support.\n",
