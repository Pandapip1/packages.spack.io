    "description": "This package consists of a couple of optimised tools for doing things\nthat can roughly be considered \"group-indexing operations\". The most\nprominent tool is `aggregate`. `aggregate` takes an array of values, and\nan array giving the group number for each of those values. It then\nreturns the sum (or mean, or std, or any, ...etc.) of the values in each\ngroup. You have probably come across this idea before, using `matlab`\naccumarray, `pandas` groupby, or generally MapReduce algorithms and\nhistograms. There are different implementations of `aggregate` provided,\nbased on plain `numpy`, `numba` and `weave`. Performance is a main\nconcern, and so far we comfortably beat similar implementations in other\npackages (check the benchmarks).\n",
