    "description": "Wrapper for 'FFTW3' Includes: One-Dimensional Univariate, One-\nDimensional Multivariate, and Two-Dimensional Transform Provides a\nwrapper for several 'FFTW' functions. This package provides access to\nthe two-dimensional 'FFT', the multivariate 'FFT', and the one-\ndimensional real to complex 'FFT' using the 'FFTW3' library. The package\nincludes the functions fftw() and mvfftw() which are designed to mimic\nthe functionality of the R functions fft() and mvfft(). The 'FFT'\nfunctions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant\ncomplex conjugate when the input is real data.\n",

We believe that FFTW, which\nis free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most\napplications."
