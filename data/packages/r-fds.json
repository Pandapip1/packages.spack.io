This provides a great deal of control over the\nHTTP/FTP/... connection and the form of the request while providing a\nhigher-level interface than is available just using R socket\nconnections. Additionally, the underlying implementation is robust and\nextensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads), SSL/HTTPS,\ntelnet, dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects,\nauthentication, etc."
