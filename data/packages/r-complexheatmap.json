Plotting functions for displaying and\nassessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL\nspace, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation\nfunctions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and\nsimulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly,\ntritanomaly).
