    "description": "Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components\ncontributing to data with a bilinear structure; the basic technique may\nbe extended to alternating constrained least squares. Commonly applied\nconstraints include unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of\ncomponents. Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by\nassuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is\nshared between datasets.\n",
