    "description": "Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes Tools to\nassess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, several\nmethodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis\ntesting about the independence between the processes, a suitable\nnonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and\nan F test for assessing the multiple correlation between one spatial\nprocess and several others. Functions for image processing and computing\nthe spatial association between images are also provided.\n",
