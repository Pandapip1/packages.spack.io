StarPU takes care of scheduling and executing those tasks as\nefficiently as possible over the entire machine. It also provides a\nhigh-level data management library which enforces memory coherency over\nthe differents processing units of the machine, and over a cluster when\nusing distributed computing. Various data structures are supported\nmainline (vectors, dense matrices, CSR/BCSR/COO sparse matrices, ...),\nbut application-specific data structures can also be supported.",
