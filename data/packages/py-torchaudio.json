    "description": "The aim of torchaudio is to apply PyTorch to the audio domain. By\nsupporting PyTorch, torchaudio follows the same philosophy of providing\nstrong GPU acceleration, having a focus on trainable features through\nthe autograd system, and having consistent style (tensor names and\ndimension names). Therefore, it is primarily a machine learning library\nand not a general signal processing library. The benefits of Pytorch is\nbe seen in torchaudio through having all the computations be through\nPytorch operations which makes it easy to use and feel like a natural\nextension.\n",
