    "description": "SPGL1 is a solver for large-scale one-norm regularized least squares. It\nis designed to solve any of the following three problems: Basis pursuit\ndenoise (BPDN): minimize ||x||_1 subject to ||Ax - b||_2 <= sigma, Basis\npursuit (BP): minimize ||x||_1 subject to Ax = b Lasso: minimize ||Ax -\nb||_2 subject to ||x||_1 <= tau, The matrix A can be defined explicitly,\nor as an operator that returns both both Ax and A'b. SPGL1 can solve\nthese three problems in both the real and complex domains.\n",
