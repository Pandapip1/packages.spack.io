    "description": "Exact Goodness-of-Fit Test for Multinomial Data with Fixed\nProbabilities. Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio.\nFor example, a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types in\nthe relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1. To see whether a set of observed\ncounts fits this expectation, one can examine all possible outcomes with\nxmulti() or a random sample of them with xmonte() and find the\nprobability of an observation deviating from the expectation by at least\nas much as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected,\none can use the log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial probability, or\nthe classic chi-square statistic. A histogram of the test statistic can\nalso be plotted and compared with the asymptotic curve.\n",
