Provides a mapping between\nMunsell's original notation (e.g. \"5R 5/10\") and hexadecimal strings\nsuitable for use directly in R graphics. Also provides utilities to\nexplore slices through the Munsell colour tree, to transform Munsell\ncolours and display colour palettes.\n",

            "description": "A Toolbox for Manipulating and Assessing Colors and Palettes. Carries\nout mapping between assorted color spaces including RGB, HSV, HLS,\nCIEXYZ, CIELUV, HCL (polar CIELUV), CIELAB, and polar CIELAB.\nQualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL\ncolors are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color\npalette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a\nshiny graphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker\nand a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for\ndisplaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations\nof the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color\nmanipulation functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening,\nmixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly,\nprotanomaly, tritanomaly). Details can be found on the project web page\nat <https://colorspace.R-Forge.R-project.org/> and in the accompanying\nscientific paper: Zeileis et al. (2020, Journal of Statistical Software,\n<doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01>)."
