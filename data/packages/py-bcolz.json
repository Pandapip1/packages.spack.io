    "description": "bcolz provides columnar and compressed data containers. Column storage\nallows for efficiently querying tables with a large number of columns.\nIt also allows for cheap addition and removal of column. In addition,\nbcolz objects are compressed by default for reducing memory/disk I/O\nneeds. The compression process is carried out internally by Blosc, a\nhigh-performance compressor that is optimized for binary data.\n",
