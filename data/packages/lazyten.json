This project is a joint project between Debian, Octave and\nScilab in order to provide a common and maintained version of arpack.\nIndeed, no single release has been published by Rice university for the\nlast few years and since many software (Octave, Scilab, R, Matlab...)\nforked it and implemented their own modifications, arpack-ng aims to\ntackle this by providing a common repository and maintained versions.\narpack-ng is replacing arpack almost everywhere."
