    "description": "SuperChic is a Fortran based Monte Carlo event generator for exclusive\nand photon-initiated production in proton and heavy ion collisions. A\nrange of Standard Model final states are implemented, in most cases with\nspin correlations where relevant, and a fully differential treatment of\nthe soft survival factor is given. Arbitrary user-defined histograms and\ncuts may be made, as well as unweighted events in the HEPEVT, HEPMC and\nLHE formats.\n",
