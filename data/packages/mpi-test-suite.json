The main focus is on: -\nHigh degree of code coverage through combinations of tests. - Easy\nmaintainability, - Easy integration of new tests, - Rich underlying\nfunctionality for flexible tests (convenience functions for datatypes,\ncomms and checking), - Only a single binary (for single, since expensive\nMPI_Init/MPI_Finalize) to make it as quick and easy as possible to run\nautomatically\n",
