    "description": "Numexpr3 is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it,\nexpressions that operate on arrays (like \"3*a+4*b\") are accelerated and\nuse less memory than doing the same calculation in Python. In addition,\nits multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your cores, which\nmay accelerate computations, most specially if they are not memory-\nbounded (e.g. those using transcendental functions). Compared to NumExpr\n2.6, functions have been re-written in a fashion such that gcc can auto-\nvectorize them with SIMD instruction sets such as SSE2 or AVX2, if your\nprocessor supports them. Use of a newer version of gcc such as 5.4 is\nstrongly recommended.\n",
