    "description": "Tools for Managing SSH and Git Credentials Setup and retrieve HTTPS and\nSSH credentials for use with 'git' and other services. For HTTPS remotes\nthe package interfaces the 'git-credential' utility which 'git' uses to\nstore HTTP usernames and passwords. For SSH remotes we provide\nconvenient functions to find or generate appropriate SSH keys. The\npackage both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and also\nprovides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate with\nexisting user credentials.\n",

High-level envelope functions combine RSA and AES\nfor encrypting arbitrary sized data.

The core of the package implements a framework for\nperforming fully customized requests where data can be processed either\nin memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection\ninterfaces.

The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools\nfor working with JSON in R and is particularly powerful for building\npipelines and interacting with a web API. The implementation is based on\nthe mapping described in the vignette (Ooms, 2014). In addition to\nconverting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains functions to\nstream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with\nthe package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded\nconsistently for use with dynamic data in systems and applications."
