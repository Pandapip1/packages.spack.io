    "description": "Ragel State Machine Compiler Ragel compiles executable finite state\nmachines from regular languages. Ragel targets C, C++ and ASM. Ragel\nstate machines can not only recognize byte sequences as regular\nexpression machines do, but can also execute code at arbitrary points in\nthe recognition of a regular language. Code embedding is done using\ninline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.\n",
