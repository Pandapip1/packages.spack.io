    "description": "Python is a powerful, dynamic language. Rather than bake everything into\nthe language, it lets the programmer customize it to make it work for\nthem. fastcore uses this flexibility to add to Python features inspired\nby other languages we've loved, like multiple dispatch from Julia,\nmixins from Ruby, and currying, binding, and more from Haskell. It also\nadds some \"missing features\" and clean up some rough edges in the Python\nstandard library, such as simplifying parallel processing, and bringing\nideas from NumPy over to Python's list type.\n",
