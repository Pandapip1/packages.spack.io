The package includes efficient linear model solver and\ntree learning algorithms. The package can automatically do parallel\ncomputation on a single machine which could be more than 10 times faster\nthan existing gradient boosting packages. It supports various objective\nfunctions, including regression, classification and ranking. The package\nis made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define their\nown objectives easily.\n",
