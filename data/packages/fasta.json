    "description": "The FASTA programs find regions of local or global similarity between\nProtein or DNA sequences, either by searching Protein or DNA databases,\nor by identifying local duplications within a sequence. Other programs\nprovide information on the statistical significance of an alignment.\nLike BLAST, FASTA can be used to infer functional and evolutionary\nrelationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene\nfamilies.\n",
