MFront handles material properties,\nmechanical behaviours and simple point-wise models. Interfaces are\nprovided for several finite element solvers, such as: Abaqus/Standard,\nAbaqus/Explicit, Ansys APDL, Cast3M, Europlexus, Code_Aster, CalculiX\nand a few others. MFront comes with an handy easy-to-use tool called\nMTest that can test the local behaviour of a material, by imposing\nindependent constraints on each component of the strain or the stress."
