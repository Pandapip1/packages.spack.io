Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses\nthe data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph\nwith the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also seamlessly integrates\nwith pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for large-scale\nand fully automated analysis."
