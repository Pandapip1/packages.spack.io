Package builds on the basic\nals function from the ALS package and adds functionality for high-\nthroughput analysis, including definition of time windows, clustering of\nprofiles, retention time correction, etcetera.\n",

            "description": "Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components\ncontributing to data with a bilinear structure; the basic technique may\nbe extended to alternating constrained least squares. Commonly applied\nconstraints include unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of\ncomponents. Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by\nassuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is\nshared between datasets."

            "description": "Parametric Time Warping Parametric Time Warping aligns patterns, i.e. it\naims to put corresponding features at the same locations. The algorithm\nsearches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping. It is\npossible to align one sample to a reference, several samples to the same\nreference, or several samples to several references. One can choose\nbetween calculating individual warpings, or one global warping for a set\nof samples and one reference. Two optimization criteria are implemented:\nRMS (Root Mean Square error) and WCC (Weighted Cross Correlation). Both\nwarping of peak profiles and of peak lists are supported. A vignette for\nthe latter is contained in the inst/doc directory of the source package\n- the vignette source can be found on the package github site."
