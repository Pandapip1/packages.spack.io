An object-oriented modeling language\nfor disciplined convex programming (DCP) as described in Fu, Narasimhan,\nand Boyd (2020, <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i14>). It allows the user to\nformulate convex optimization problems in a natural way following\nmathematical convention and DCP rules. The system analyzes the problem,\nverifies its convexity, converts it into a canonical form, and hands it\noff to an appropriate solver to obtain the solution. Interfaces to\nsolvers on CRAN and elsewhere are provided, both commercial and open\nsource."
