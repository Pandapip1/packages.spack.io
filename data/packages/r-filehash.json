    "description": "Implements a simple key-value style database where character string keys\nare associated with data values that are stored on the disk. A simple\ninterface is provided for inserting, retrieving, and deleting data from\nthe database. Utilities are provided that allow 'filehash' databases to\nbe treated much like environments and lists are already used in R. These\nutilities are provided to encourage interactive and exploratory analysis\non large datasets. Three different file formats for representing the\ndatabase are currently available and new formats can easily be\nincorporated by third parties for use in the 'filehash' framework.\n",
