    "description": "Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference\ngenome. It is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and\ninsertion/deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms, and simulate reads with\nuniform substitution sequencing errors. It does not generate INDEL\nsequencing errors, but this can be partly compensated by simulating\nINDEL polymorphisms.\n",
