    "description": "This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to both R and\n'Python'. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative clustering\nroutines. Part of the functionality is designed as drop-in replacement\nfor existing routines: linkage() in the 'SciPy' package\n'scipy.cluster.hierarchy', hclust() in R's 'stats' package, and the\n'flashClust' package. It provides the same functionality with the\nbenefit of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are memory-\nsaving routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond what the\nexisting packages provide. For information on how to install the\n'Python' files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution.\n",

            "description": "Trinity, developed at the Broad Institute and the Hebrew University of\nJerusalem, represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de\nnovo reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity\ncombines three independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and\nButterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq\nreads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual de\nBruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a\ngiven gene or locus, and then processes each graph independently to\nextract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease apart transcripts\nderived from paralogous genes."
