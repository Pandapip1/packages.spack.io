An advanced use case is dynamically coordinating hardware\nsettings across all compute nodes used by a distributed application is\nresponse to the application's behavior and requests from the resource\nmanager. Note: GEOPM interfaces with hardware using Model Specific\nRegisters (MSRs). For proper usage make sure MSRs are made available via\nthe msr or msr-safe kernel modules by your administrator."
