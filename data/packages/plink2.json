Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
