    "description": "Tools for Spatial Data. For curve, surface and function fitting with an\nemphasis; on splines, spatial data, geostatistics, and spatial\nstatistics. The major methods; include cubic, and thin plate splines,\nKriging, and compactly supported; covariance functions for large data\nsets. The splines and Kriging methods are; supported by functions that\ncan determine the smoothing parameter; (nugget and sill variance) and\nother covariance function parameters by cross; validation and also by\nrestricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging; there is an easy to use\nfunction that also estimates the correlation; scale (range parameter). A\nmajor feature is that any covariance function; implemented in R and\nfollowing a simple format can be used for; spatial prediction. There are\nalso many useful functions for plotting; and working with spatial data\nas images. This package also contains; an implementation of sparse\nmatrix methods for large spatial data; sets and currently requires the\nsparse matrix (spam) package. Use; help(fields) to get started and for\nan overview. The fields source; code is deliberately commented and\nprovides useful explanations of; numerical details as a companion to the\nmanual pages. The commented; source code can be viewed by expanding the\nsource code version; and looking in the R subdirectory. The reference\nfor fields can be generated; by the citation function in R and has DOI\n<doi:10.5065/D6W957CT>. Development; of this package was supported in\npart by the National Science Foundation Grant; 1417857, the National\nCenter for Atmospheric Research, and Colorado School of Mines.; See the\nFields URL; for a vignette on using this package and some background on\nspatial statistics.\n",
