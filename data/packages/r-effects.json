Qualitative,\nsequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL colors are\nprovided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette\nchoice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny\ngraphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a\ncolor vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and\nassessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL\nspace, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation\nfunctions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and\nsimulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly,\ntritanomaly). Details can be found on the project web page at\n<https://colorspace.R-Forge.R-project.org/> and in the accompanying\nscientific paper: Zeileis et al.
