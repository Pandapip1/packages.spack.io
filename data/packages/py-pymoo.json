It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a.\nbackpropagation), which means it can efficiently take gradients of\nscalar-valued functions with respect to array-valued arguments, as well\nas forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed\narbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd is gradient-based\noptimization. For more information, check out the tutorial and the\nexamples directory.",
