If none is set, it will fall back to parallel::detectCores().\nAnother example is makeClusterPSOCK(), which is backward compatible with\nparallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better job in setting up\nremote cluster workers without the need for configuring the firewall to\ndo port-forwarding to your local computer."
