YARN is meant to make it easier for the user in\nperforming basic mis-annotation quality control, filtering, and\ncondition-aware normalization. YARN leverages many Bioconductor tools\nand statistical techniques to account for the large heterogeneity and\nsparsity found in very large RNA-seq experiments.\n",
