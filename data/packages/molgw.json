    "description": "MOLGW is a quantum chemistry code that implements the many-body\nperturbation theory (MBPT) to describe the excited electronic states in\nfinite systems (atoms, molecules, clusters). MOLGW implements the GW\napproximation for the self-energy (ionization and affinity) and the\nBethe-Salpeter equation for the optical excitations. MOLGW also applies\nthe real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (RT-TDDFT). MOLGW\nemploys standard Gaussian basis set.\n",

XBLAS is a\nreference implementation for the dense and banded BLAS routines, along\nwith extended and mixed precision version. Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
