    "description": "MOLGW is a quantum chemistry code that implements the many-body\nperturbation theory (MBPT) to describe the excited electronic states in\nfinite systems (atoms, molecules, clusters). MOLGW implements the GW\napproximation for the self-energy (ionization and affinity) and the\nBethe-Salpeter equation for the optical excitations. MOLGW also applies\nthe real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (RT-TDDFT). MOLGW\nemploys standard Gaussian basis set.\n",
