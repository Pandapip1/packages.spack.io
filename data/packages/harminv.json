    "description": "Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the\nproblem of harmonic inversion - given a discrete-time, finite-length\nsignal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly\nexponentially decaying) in a given bandwidth, it determines the\nfrequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those sinusoids.\n",

            "description": "XBLAS is a reference implementation for extra precision BLAS. XBLAS is a\nreference implementation for the dense and banded BLAS routines, along\nwith extended and mixed precision version. Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
