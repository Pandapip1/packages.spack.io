    "description": "Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the\nproblem of harmonic inversion - given a discrete-time, finite-length\nsignal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly\nexponentially decaying) in a given bandwidth, it determines the\nfrequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those sinusoids.\n",
