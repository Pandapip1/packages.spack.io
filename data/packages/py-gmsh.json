Its design goal is to provide a fast, light\nand user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced\nvisualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry,\nmesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to\nthese modules is done either interactively using the graphical user\ninterface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language."
