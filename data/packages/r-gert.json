    "description": "Simple Git Client for R Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' with\nsupport for SSH and HTTPS remotes. All functions in 'gert' use basic R\ndata types (such as vectors and data-frames) for their arguments and\nreturn values. User credentials are shared with command line 'git'\nthrough the git-credential store and ssh keys stored on disk or ssh-\nagent. On Linux, a somewhat recent version of 'libgit2' is required; we\nprovide a 'PPA' for older Ubuntu 'LTS' versions.\n",

Password entry can be invoked in two different\nways: directly from R via the askpass() function, or indirectly as\npassword-entry back-end for 'ssh-agent' or 'git-credential' via the\nSSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables. Thereby the user can\nbe prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed when R calls out\nto git or ssh."

For SSH remotes we provide\nconvenient functions to find or generate appropriate SSH keys. The\npackage both helps the user to setup a local git installation, and also\nprovides a back-end for git/ssh client libraries to authenticate with\nexisting user credentials."
