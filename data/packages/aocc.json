The AOCC compiler system\noffers a high level of advanced optimizations, multi-threading and\nprocessor support that includes global optimization, vectorization,\ninter-procedural analyses, loop transformations, and code generation.\nAMD also provides highly optimized libraries, which extract the optimal\nperformance from each x86 processor core when utilized. The AOCC\nCompiler Suite simplifies and accelerates development and tuning for x86\napplications. Installation requires acceptance of the EULA by setting\nthe +license-agreed variant.\nhttps://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/files/AOCC_EULA.pdf Example\nfor installation: 'spack install aocc +license-agreed'\n",
