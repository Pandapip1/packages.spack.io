    "description": "Fast, Low Memory-Footprint Digests of R Objects. Provides an R interface\nto Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic 'SpookyHash' hash algorithm\nfor use in digest-based comparisons of R objects. 'fastdigest' plugs\ndirectly into R's internal serialization machinery, allowing digests of\nall R objects the serialize() function supports, including reference-\nstyle objects via custom hooks. Speed is high and scales linearly by\nobject size; memory usage is constant and negligible.\n",

Provides the core framework for a discrete event system (DES) to\nimplement acomplete data-to-decisions, reproducible workflow. The core\nDES components facilitate modularity, and easily enable the user to\ninclude additional functionality by running user-built modules. Includes\nconditional scheduling, restart after interruption, packaging of\nreusable modules, tools for developing arbitrary automated workflows,\nautomated interweaving of modules of different temporal resolution, and\ntools for visualizing and understanding the DES project."
