A proprietary\nprogramming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix\nmanipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of\nalgorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs\nwritten in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and\nPython. Note: MATLAB is licensed software. You will need to create an\naccount on the MathWorks homepage and download MATLAB yourself. Spack\nwill search your current directory for the download file.
