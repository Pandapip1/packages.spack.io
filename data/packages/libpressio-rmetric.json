C++ classes to embed\nR in C++ applications The 'RInside' packages makes it easier to have \"R\ninside\" your C++ application by providing a C++ wrapperclass providing\nthe R interpreter. As R itself is embedded into your application, a\nshared library build of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and\neven on Windows provided you use the same tools used to build R itself.\nNumerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories of the\nexamples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for\nparallel computing) qt (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt GUI\napplication), wt (showing how to build a \"web-application\" using the Wt\ntoolkit), armadillo (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppArmadillo') and eigen\n(for 'RInside' use with 'RcppEigen'). The example use GNUmakefile(s)\nwith GNU extensions, so a GNU make is required (and will use the\nGNUmakefile automatically). Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++\nclasses is available at the 'RInside' website as well."
