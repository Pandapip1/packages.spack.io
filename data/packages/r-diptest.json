Clustering by merging Gaussian mixture components. Symmetric\nand asymmetric discriminant projections for visualisation of the\nseparation of groupings. Cluster validation statistics for distance\nbased clustering including corrected Rand index. Standardisation of\ncluster validation statistics by random clusterings and comparison\nbetween many clustering methods and numbers of clusters based on this.\nCluster-wise cluster stability assessment. Methods for estimation of the\nnumber of clusters: Calinski-Harabasz, Tibshirani and Walther's\nprediction strength, Fang and Wang's bootstrap stability.\nGaussian/multinomial mixture fitting for mixed continuous/categorical\nvariables. Variable-wise statistics for cluster interpretation. DBSCAN\nclustering. Interface functions for many clustering methods implemented\nin R, including estimating the number of clusters with kmeans, pam and\nclara. Modality diagnosis for Gaussian mixtures.
