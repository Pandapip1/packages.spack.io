    "description": "OrthoFinder is a fast, accurate and comprehensive analysis tool for\ncomparative genomics. It finds orthologues and orthogroups infers rooted\ngene trees for all orthogroups and infers a rooted species tree for the\nspecies being analysed. OrthoFinder also provides comprehensive\nstatistics for comparative genomic analyses. OrthoFinder is simple to\nuse and all you need to run it is a set of protein sequence files (one\nper species) in FASTA format.\n",
