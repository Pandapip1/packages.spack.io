    "description": "Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes.\nCommon operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than with\nNumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times less\nmemory is used to store them. Tinyarrays are useful if you need many\nsmall arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.\n",
