Qualitative,\nsequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL colors are\nprovided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette\nchoice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny\ngraphical user interface) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a\ncolor vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and\nassessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL\nspace, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation\nfunctions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and\nsimulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly,\ntritanomaly). Details can be found on the project web page at\n<https://colorspace.R-Forge.R-project.org/> and in the accompanying\nscientific paper: Zeileis et al. (2020, Journal of Statistical Software,\n<doi:10.18637/jss.v096.i01>)."

Heiberger and Burt Holland. This\ncontemporary presentation of statistical methods features extensive use\nof graphical displays for exploring data and for displaying the\nanalysis. The second edition includes redesigned graphics and additional\nchapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs,\ndiscuss principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying\ntraditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual impressions\nderived directly from the graphs. Many of the graphical formats are\nnovel and appear here for the first time in print. All chapters have\nexercises. All functions introduced in the book are in the package. R\ncode for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included\nin the scripts directory of the package."
