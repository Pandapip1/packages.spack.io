    "description": "Envisage is a Python-based framework for building extensible\napplications, that is, applications whose functionality can be extended\nby adding \"plug-ins\". Envisage provides a standard mechanism for\nfeatures to be added to an application, whether by the original\ndeveloper or by someone else. In fact, when you build an application\nusing Envisage, the entire application consists primarily of plug-ins.\nIn this respect, it is similar to the Eclipse and Netbeans frameworks\nfor Java applications.\n",
