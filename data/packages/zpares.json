BLIS is written in ISO\nC99 and available under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license. While BLIS\nexports a new BLAS-like API, it also includes a BLAS compatibility layer\nwhich gives application developers access to BLIS implementations via\ntraditional BLAS routine calls. An object-based API unique to BLIS is\nalso available."
