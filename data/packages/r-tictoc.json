    "description": "tictoc: Functions for timing R scripts, as well as implementations of\nStack and List structures This package provides the timing functions\n'tic' and 'toc' that can be nested. One can record all timings while a\ncomplex script is running, and examine the values later. It is also\npossible to instrument the timing calls with custom callbacks. In\naddition, this package provides class 'Stack', implemented as a vector,\nand class 'List', implemented as a list, both of which support\noperations 'push', 'pop', 'first', 'last' and 'clear'.\n",
