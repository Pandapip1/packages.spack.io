A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but\nthe required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A\nDaemonContext instance holds the behaviour and configured process\nenvironment for the program; use the instance as a context manager to\nenter a daemon state.\n",

The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the\nlink (on Unix) and mkdir (on Windows) system calls. An implementation\nbased on SQLite is also provided, more as a demonstration of the\npossibilities it provides than as production-quality code."
