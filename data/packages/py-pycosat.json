This\npackage provides efficient Python bindings to picosat on the C level,\ni.e. when importing pycosat, the picosat solver becomes part of the\nPython process itself. For ease of deployment, the picosat source\n(namely picosat.c and picosat.h) is included in this project. These\nfiles have been extracted from the picosat source (picosat-965.tar.gz).\n",
