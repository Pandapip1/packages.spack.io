    "description": "The Electrophys Feature Extract Library (eFEL) allows neuroscientists to\nautomatically extract features from time series data recorded from\nneurons (both in vitro and in silico). Examples are the action potential\nwidth and amplitude in voltage traces recorded during whole-cell patch\nclamp experiments. The user of the library provides a set of traces and\nselects the features to be calculated. The library will then extract the\nrequested features and return the values to the user.\n",
