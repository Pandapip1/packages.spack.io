    "description": "Proxy Application. VPFFT is an implementation of a mesoscale\nmicromechanical materials model. By solving the viscoplasticity model,\nVPFFT simulates the evolution of a material under deformation. The\nsolution time to the viscoplasticity model, described by a set of\npartial differential equations, is significantly reduced by the\napplication of Fast Fourier Transform in the VPFFT algorithm.\n",

We believe that FFTW, which\nis free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most\napplications."
