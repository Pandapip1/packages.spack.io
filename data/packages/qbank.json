It is used in conjunction with a resource\nmanagement system allowing an organization to guarantee greater fairness\nand enforce mission priorities by associating a charge with the use of\ncomputational resources and allocating resource credits which limit how\nmuch of the resources may be used at what time and by whom. It tracks\nresource utilization and allows for insightful planning.\n",
