It provides the\nspatial discretization and time integration functions, functions to read\nand write solutions from/to files, as well as functions required to\nsolve the system on parallel (MPI) platforms. The physical models define\nthe physics-specific functions such as the exact forms of the hyperbolic\nflux, parabolic flux, source terms, upwinding functions, etc.\n",

There is an optional backward compatibility layer,\nlapack2flame that maps LAPACK routine invocations to their corresponding\nnative C implementations in libFLAME. This allows legacy applications to\nstart taking advantage of libFLAME with virtually no changes to their\nsource code. In combination with BLIS library which includes\noptimizations for the AMD EPYC processor family, libFLAME enables\nrunning high performing LAPACK functionalities on AMD platform.\nLICENSING INFORMATION: By downloading, installing and using this\nsoftware, you agree to the terms and conditions of the AMD AOCL-libFLAME\nlicense agreement.
