The solution of\ncontinuum mechanical boundary value problems requires a constitutive\nresponse that connects deformation and stress at each material point.\nThis problem is solved in DAMASK on the basis of crystal plasticity\nusing a variety of constitutive models and homogenization approaches.\nHowever, treating mechanics in isolation is no longer sufficient to\nstudy emergent advanced high-strength materials. In these materials,\ndeformation happens interrelated with displacive phase transformation,\nsignificant heating, and potential damage evolution. Therefore, DAMASK\nis capable of handling multi-physics problems. Following a modular\napproach, additional field equations are solved in a fully coupled way\nusing a staggered approach."
