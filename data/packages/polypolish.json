    "description": "Polypolish is a tool for polishing genome assemblies with short reads.\nUnlike other tools in this category, Polypolish uses SAM files where\neach read has been aligned to all possible locations (not just a single\nbest location). This allows it to repair errors in repeat regions that\nother alignment-based polishers cannot fix.\n",
