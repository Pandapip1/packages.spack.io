In addition to commonly used\nplotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely\nbaseline subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or\nthe statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm\n(SNIP), peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated\nmeasurements as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions.\n",
