    "description": "The FInite element Automatic Tabulator FIAT supports generation of\narbitrary order instances of the Lagrange elements on lines, triangles,\nand tetrahedra. It is also capable of generating arbitrary order\ninstances of Jacobi-type quadrature rules on the same element shapes.\nFurther, H(div) and H(curl) conforming finite element spaces such as the\nfamilies of Raviart-Thomas, Brezzi-Douglas-Marini and Nedelec are\nsupported on triangles and tetrahedra. Upcoming versions will also\nsupport Hermite and nonconforming elements\n",
