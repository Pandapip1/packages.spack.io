    "description": "Parallel Computing Toolset for Relatedness and Principal Component\nAnalysis of SNP Data Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely\nused to investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they\npose many computational challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate\nto provide a binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data\nin GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files. The\nGDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed for\nintegers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits.\nSNPRelate is also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP\ndata using parallel computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing\ncomputer architectures: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and\nrelatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP GDS\nformat is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4\nclasses and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented in\nthe SeqArray package to support the storage of single nucleotide\nvariations (SNVs), insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) and\nstructural variation calls.\n",

It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially\nfor data which are much larger than the available random- access memory.\nThe gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations specifically designed\nfor integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid genotype, like single-\nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies fewer bits than a byte.\nData compression and decompression are available with relatively\nefficient random access. It is also allowed to read a GDS file in\nparallel with multiple R processes supported by the package parallel."
