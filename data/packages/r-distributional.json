In addition to providing generic replacements for p/d/q/r\nfunctions, other useful statistics can be computed including means,\nvariances, intervals, and highest density regions.\n",

For md5,\nsha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone\nimplementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code\nfrom the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation by Aaron\nD. Gifford is used. For xxhash, the implementation by Yann Collet is\nused. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is used.
