    "description": "The DSDP software is a free open source implementation of an interior-\npoint method for semidefinite programming. It provides primal and dual\nsolutions, exploits low-rank structure and sparsity in the data, and has\nrelatively low memory requirements for an interior-point method. It\nallows feasible and infeasible starting points and provides approximate\ncertificates of infeasibility when no feasible solution exists.\n",

XBLAS is a\nreference implementation for the dense and banded BLAS routines, along\nwith extended and mixed precision version. Extended precision is only\nused internally; input and output arguments remain the same as in the\nexisting BLAS. Extra precisions is implemented as double-double (i.e.,\n128-bit total, 106-bit significand). Mixed precision permits some\ninput/output arguments of different types (mixing real and complex) or\nprecisions (mixing single and double). This implementation is proof of\nconcept, and no attempt was made to optimize performance; performance\nshould be as good as straightforward but careful code written by hand."
