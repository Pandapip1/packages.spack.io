    "description": "cython_bbox is widely used in object detection tasks. To my best\nknowledge, it was first implemented in Faster-RCNN. Since then, almost\nall object detection projects use the source code directly. In order to\nuse it in standalone code snippets or small projects, I make it a pypi\nmodule. The cython_bbox.pyx is totally borrowed from Faster-RCNN. Thanks\nRBG!\n",
