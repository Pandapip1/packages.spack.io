    "description": "MotionCor2 is a multi-GPU program that corrects beam-induced sample\nmotion recorded on dose fractionated movie stacks. It implements a\nrobust iterative alignment algorithm that delivers precise measurement\nand correction of both global and non-uniform local motions at single\npixel level, suitable for both single-particle and tomographic images.\nMotionCor2 is sufficiently fast to keep up with automated data\ncollection.\n",
