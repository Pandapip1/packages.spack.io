If conflicts are encountered, figure out\nexactly which pairs of commits conflict, and present the user with one\npairwise conflict at a time for resolution. git-imerge has two primary\ndesign goals: * Reduce the pain of resolving merge conflicts to its\nunavoidable minimum, by finding and presenting the smallest possible\nconflicts: those between the changes introduced by one commit from each\nbranch. * Allow a merge to be saved, tested, interrupted, published, and\ncollaborated on while it is in progress.\n",
