    "description": "Pythonic mix-ins for ROOT classes. This package is typically used as a\ndependency for uproot 3.x, to define methods on the classes that are\nautomatically generated from ROOT files. This includes histograms (TH*)\nand physics objects like TLorentzVectors. The reason it's a separate\nlibrary is so that we can add physics-specific functionality on a\nshorter timescale than we can update Uproot 3 itself, which is purely an\nI/O package.\n",
