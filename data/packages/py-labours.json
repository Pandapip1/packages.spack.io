In practice\nthis means that HDBSCAN returns a good clustering straight away with\nlittle or no parameter tuning -- and the primary parameter, minimum\ncluster size, is intuitive and easy to select. HDBSCAN is ideal for\nexploratory data analysis; it's a fast and robust algorithm that you can\ntrust to return meaningful clusters (if there are any)."
