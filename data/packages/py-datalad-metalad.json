To do that, it stands\non the shoulders of Git and Git-annex to deliver a decentralized system\nfor data exchange. This includes automated ingestion of data from online\nportals and exposing it in readily usable form as Git(-annex)\nrepositories, so-called datasets. The actual data storage and permission\nmanagement, however, remains with the original data providers."
