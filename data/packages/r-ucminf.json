    "description": "General-Purpose Unconstrained Non-Linear Optimization. An algorithm for\ngeneral-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization. The algorithm is\nof quasi-Newton type with BFGS updating of the inverse Hessian and soft\nline search with a trust region type monitoring of the input to the line\nsearch algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is designed for easy\ninterchange with 'optim'.\n",

Implementation of cumulative link\n(mixed) models also known as ordered regression models, proportional\nodds models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times and\nordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood\nand mixed models are fitted with the Laplace approximation and adaptive\nGauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect terms are allowed and\nthey may be nested, crossed or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of\nsymmetry and equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-\npoints/intercepts). Standard model methods are available (summary,\nanova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to profile\nmethods and slice methods for visualizing the likelihood function and\nchecking convergence."
