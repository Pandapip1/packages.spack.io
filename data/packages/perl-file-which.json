MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to\na genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically\nsynthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based\nquality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary\nruns can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm,\nproducing higher quality gene-models on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs\nare minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database.\nThey can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of\nMAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual\ncontigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove\nespecially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal\nbioinformatics expertise and computer resources. Note: MAKER requires\nregistration.
