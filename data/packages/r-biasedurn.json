The test for differential\nvariability is based on an empirical Bayes version of Levene's test.\nDifferential methylation testing is performed using RUV, which can\nadjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data\nby using negative control probes. Gene ontology analysis is performed by\ntaking into account the number of probes per gene on the array, as well\nas taking into account multi-gene associated probes."
