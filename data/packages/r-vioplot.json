GOfuncR provides the standard candidate\nvs. background enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as\nwell as three additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is\nused when genes are ranked, (ii) a binomial test that is used when genes\nare associated with two counts and (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact\ntest that is used in cases when genes are associated with four counts.\nTo correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests,\nfamily-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations of the\ngene-associated variables. GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the\nontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or\nspatial clustering of genes into account. It is also possible to provide\ncustom gene coordinates, annotations and ontologies."
