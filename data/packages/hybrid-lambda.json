    "description": "Hybrid-Lambda is a software package that can simulate gene trees within\na rooted species network or a rooted species tree under the coalescent\nprocess. The main feature of this program is that users can choose to\nuse the standard Kingman coalescent process, which produces bifurcating\ngenealogies, or two other Lambda coalescent processes, which produce\nmultifurcating genealogies. The other feature is that hybrid sim uses\nextended Newick formatted strings to make it easier to represent\nhybridization events between species.\n",
