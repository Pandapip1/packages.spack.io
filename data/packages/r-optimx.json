    "description": "Expanded Replacement and Extension of the 'optim' Function: Provides a\nreplacement and extension of the optim() function to call to several\nfunction minimization codes in R in a single statement. These methods\nhandle smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or many\nparameters. Note that function 'optimr()' was prepared to simplify the\nincorporation of minimization codes going forward. Also implements some\nutility codes and some extra solvers, including safeguarded Newton\nmethods. Many methods previously separate are now included here. This is\nthe version for CRAN.\n",
