Compared to previous MD\nproxy apps (MiniMD, COMD), its design is significantly more modular in\norder to allow independent investigation of different aspects. To\nachieve that the main components such as force calculation,\ncommunication, neighbor list construction and binning are derived\nclasses whose main functionality is accessed via virtual functions. This\nallows a developer to write a new derived class and drop it into the\ncode without touching much of the rest of the application.\n",
