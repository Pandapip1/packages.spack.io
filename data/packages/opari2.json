OPARI2 will provide you with a\nnew initialization method that allows for multi-directory and parallel\nbuilds as well as the usage of pre-instrumented libraries. Furthermore,\nan efficient way of tracking parent-child relationships was added.\nAdditionally, we extended OPARI2 to support instrumentation of OpenMP\n3.0 tied tasks.\n",
