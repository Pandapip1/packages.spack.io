A collection of tools to evaluate\nprobability density functions, cumulative distribution functions,\nquantile functions and random numbers for truncated random variables.\nThese functions are provided to also compute the expected value and\nvariance. Nadarajah and Kotz (2006) developed most of the functions. QQ\nplots can be produced. All the probability functions in the stats,\nstats4 and evd packages are automatically available for truncation.\n",
