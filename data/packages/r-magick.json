    "description": "Advanced Graphics and Image-Processing in R Bindings to 'ImageMagick':\nthe most comprehensive open-source image processing library available.\nSupports many common formats (png, jpeg, tiff, pdf, etc) and\nmanipulations (rotate, scale, crop, trim, flip, blur, etc). All\noperations are vectorized via the Magick++ STL meaning they operate\neither on a single frame or a series of frames for working with layers,\ncollages, or animation. In RStudio images are automatically previewed\nwhen printed to the console, resulting in an interactive editing\nenvironment. The latest version of the package includes a native\ngraphics device for creating in-memory graphics or drawing onto images\nusing pixel coordinates.\n",
