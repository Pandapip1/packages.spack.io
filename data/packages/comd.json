It is created and\nmaintained by The Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme\nEnvironments (ExMatEx). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle for\nco-design by allowing others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed\nto test performance of new architectures, programming models, etc. New\nversions of CoMD will be released to incorporate the lessons learned\nfrom the co-design process.\n",
