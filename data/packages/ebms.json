    "description": "This is a miniapp for the Energy Banding Monte Carlo (EBMC) neutron\ntransportation simulation code. It is adapted from a similar miniapp\nprovided by Andrew Siegel, whose algorithm is described in [1], where\nonly one process in a compute node is used, and the compute nodes are\ndivided into memory nodes and tracking nodes. Memory nodes do not\nparticipate in particle tracking. Obviously, there is a lot of resource\nwaste in this design.\n",
