    "description": "The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks or van der\nWaerden's normal score test can be employed, if the data do not meet the\nassumptions for one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant differences\nwere detected by the omnibus test, one may be interested in applying\npost-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons (such as Nemenyi's\ntest, Dunn's test, Conover's test, van der Waerden's test). Similarly,\none-way ANOVA with repeated measures that is also referred to as ANOVA\nwith unreplicated block design can also be conducted via the Friedman-\nTest or the Quade-test. The consequent post-hoc pairwise multiple\ncomparison tests according to Nemenyi, Conover and Quade are also\nprovided in this package. Finally Durbin's test for a two-way balanced\nincomplete block design (BIBD) is also given in this package.\n",
