    "description": "miniGMG is a compact benchmark for understanding the performance\nchallenges associated with geometric multigrid solvers found in\napplications built from AMR MG frameworks like CHOMBO or BoxLib when\nrunning on modern multi- and manycore-based supercomputers. It includes\nboth productive reference examples as well as highly-optimized\nimplementations for CPUs and GPUs. It is sufficiently general that it\nhas been used to evaluate a broad range of research topics including\nPGAS programming models and algorithmic tradeoffs inherit in multigrid.\nminiGMG was developed under the CACHE Joint Math-CS Institute. Note,\nminiGMG code has been supersceded by HPGMG.\n",
