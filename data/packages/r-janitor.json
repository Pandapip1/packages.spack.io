    "description": "Simple Tools for Examining and Cleaning Dirty Data The main janitor\nfunctions can: perfectly format data.frame column names; provide quick\none- and two-variable tabulations (i.e., frequency tables and\ncrosstabs); and isolate duplicate records. Other janitor functions\nnicely format the tabulation results. These tabulate-and-report\nfunctions approximate popular features of SPSS and Microsoft Excel. This\npackage follows the principles of the \"tidyverse\" and works well with\nthe pipe function %>%. janitor was built with beginning-to-intermediate\nR users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness. Advanced R users\ncan already do everything covered here, but with janitor they can do it\nfaster and save their thinking for the fun stuff.\n",
