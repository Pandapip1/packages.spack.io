    "description": "Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Simulates continuous distributions of random\nvectors using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Users specify the\ndistribution by an R function that evaluates the log unnormalized\ndensity. Algorithms are random walk Metropolis algorithm (function\nmetrop), simulated tempering (function temper), and morphometric random\nwalk Metropolis (Johnson and Geyer, 2012, <doi:10.1214/12-AOS1048>,\nfunction morph.metrop), which achieves geometric ergodicity by change of\nvariable.\n",

Most simulation is done in compiled C++ written in\nthe Scythe Statistical Library Version 1.0.3. All models return 'coda'\nmcmc objects that can then be summarized using the 'coda' package. Some\nuseful utility functions such as density functions, pseudo-random number\ngenerators for statistical distributions, a general purpose Metropolis\nsampling algorithm, and tools for visualization are provided."
