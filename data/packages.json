This means\nthat the objects provide a coordinated and extensible framework to do\ncomputational biology. BioPerl development focuses on Perl classes, or\ncode that is used to create objects representing biological entities.\nThere are scripts provided in the scripts/ and examples/ directories but\nscripts are not the main focus of the BioPerl developers. Of course, as\nthe objects do most of the hard work for you, all you have to do is\ncombine a number of objects together sensibly to make useful scripts.\nThe intent of the BioPerl development effort is to make reusable tools\nthat aid people in creating their own sites or job-specific\napplications. The BioPerl website at https://bioperl.org/ also attempts\nto maintain links and archives of standalone bio-related Perl tools that\nare not affiliated or related to the core BioPerl effort.

It's possible since perl 5.8.1 to\nglobally disable this feature by using the PERL_SIGNALS environment\nvariables (as specified in \"PERL_SIGNALS\" in perlrun); but there's no\nway to disable it locally, for a short period of time. That's however\nsomething you might want to do, if, for example, your Perl program calls\na C routine that will potentially run for a long time and for which you\nwant to set a timeout. This module therefore allows you to define\nUNSAFE_SIGNALS blocks in which signals will be handled \"unsafely\". Note\nthat, no matter how short you make the unsafe block, it will still be\nunsafe.

For\nthis reason it has always been recommended that one do as little as\npossible in a signal handler, and only variables that already exist be\nmanipulated. Perl 5.8.0 and later versions implements 'safe' signal\nhandling on platforms which support the POSIX sigaction() function. This\nis accomplished by having perl note that a signal has arrived, but\ndeferring the execution of the signal handler until such time as it is\nsafe to do so. Unfortunately these changes can break some existing\nscripts, if they depended on a system routine being interrupted by the\nsignal's arrival. The perl 5.8.0 implementation was modified further in\nversion 5.8.2\n"

In this way, anyone using checkpoint's\ncheckpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects\nat any time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight\nUTC) Microsoft refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the \"Microsoft R\nArchived Network\" server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>). Immediately\nafter completion of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a\nsnapshot, thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist starting\nfrom 2014-09-17.\n"

The ff package provides data structures that are stored on\ndisk but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by transparently mapping\nonly a section (pagesize) in main memory - the effective virtual memory\nconsumption per ff object. ff supports R's standard atomic data types\n'double', 'logical', 'raw' and 'integer' and non-standard atomic types\nboolean (1 bit), quad (2 bit unsigned), nibble (4 bit unsigned), byte (1\nbyte signed with NAs), ubyte (1 byte unsigned), short (2 byte signed\nwith NAs), ushort (2 byte unsigned), single (4 byte float with NAs). For\nexample 'quad' allows efficient storage of genomic data as an\n'A','T','G','C' factor. The unsigned types support 'circular'\narithmetic. There is also support for close-to-atomic types 'factor',\n'ordered', 'POSIXct', 'Date' and custom close-to-atomic types. ff not\nonly has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays with flexible\ndimorder (major column-order, major row-order and generalizations for\narrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike data.frames and\nimport/export filters for csv files. ff objects store raw data in binary\nflat files in native encoding, and complement this with metadata stored\nin R as physical and virtual attributes. ff objects have well-defined\nhybrid copying semantics, which gives rise to certain performance\nimprovements through virtualization. ff objects can be stored and\nreopened across R sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R\nobjects (using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process\nor from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of\nfinalizer options allows to work with 'permanent' files as well as\ncreating/removing 'temporary' ff files completely transparent to the\nuser. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files works\nwithout notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation. Several\naccess optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index Preprocessing and\nVirtualization are implemented to achieve good performance even with\nlarge datasets, for example virtual matrix transpose without touching a\nsingle byte on disk. Further, to reduce disk I/O, 'logicals' and non-\nstandard data types get stored native and compact on binary flat files\ni.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to represent TRUE, FALSE and NA.\nBeyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides\ncompatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram\nobjects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram,\nas.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package\n'bit': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between\ndifferent objects that can store subscript information ('bit',\n'bitwhich', ff 'boolean', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows\nto work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly\nmodify selection criteria. Further high-performance enhancements can be\nmade available upon request.x\n"

Curves from different cross-validation or\nbootstrapping runs can be averaged by different methods, and standard\ndeviations, standard errors or box plots can be used to visualize the\nvariability across the runs. The parameterization can be visualized by\nprinting cutoff values at the corresponding curve positions, or by\ncoloring the curve according to cutoff. All components of a performance\nplot can be quickly adjusted using a flexible parameter dispatching\nmechanism. Despite its flexibility, ROCR is easy to use, with only three\ncommands and reasonable default values for all optional parameters.\n"
